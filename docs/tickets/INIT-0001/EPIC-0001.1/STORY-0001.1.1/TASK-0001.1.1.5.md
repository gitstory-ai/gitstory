# TASK-0001.1.1.5: Create README.md with setup instructions

**Parent Story**: [STORY-0001.1.1](README.md)
**Status**: ✅ Complete
**Estimated Hours**: 1
**Actual Hours**: 0.5

## Objective

Create README.md with development setup instructions, including installation steps, testing commands, quality gate workflows, and contribution guidelines. This fulfills the acceptance criteria requirement for "README.md - Development setup instructions".

## Implementation Checklist

### Project Header

- [x] Add project title: "# GitStory"
- [x] Add one-sentence description: "Git-native story-driven development with AI-optimized workflows"
- [x] Add badges (optional): Python version, license, etc.

### Overview Section

- [x] Add "## Development" section (comprehensive developer setup)
- [x] Briefly describe GitStory's purpose:
  - [x] Story-driven development with ticket hierarchy
  - [x] Markdown-based prompts for AI agents/commands
  - [x] Python validation scripts for configs and workflows
  - [x] Pragmatic testing strategy (unit tests for code, docs for prompts)

### Installation Section

- [x] Add "## Development" heading (added comprehensive dev section)
- [x] Document prerequisites:
  - [x] Python 3.12 or higher (updated from 3.11)
  - [x] uv package manager
- [x] Installation steps:
  - [x] Clone repository
  - [x] Install dependencies: `uv sync --all-extras`
  - [x] Verify installation: `uv run pytest --version`

### Development Workflow Section

- [x] Add "## Development" heading
- [x] Document testing commands:
  - [x] Run all tests: `uv run pytest`
  - [x] Run with coverage: `uv run pytest --cov=src/gitstory --cov-report=html`
  - [x] Type checking: `uv run mypy src`
  - [x] Linting: `uv run ruff check src tests`
  - [x] Formatting: `uv run ruff format src tests`
- [x] Combined quality gates command:
  ```bash
  uv run ruff check src tests && \
  uv run ruff format src tests && \
  uv run mypy src && \
  uv run pytest
  ```

### Testing Strategy Section

- [x] Add "## Testing Philosophy" subsection
- [x] Brief summary of testing approach:
  - [x] Unit tests for Python code (validators, parsers, workflow plugins)
  - [x] Documentation for markdown prompts (agents, commands)
  - [x] NO BDD/pytest-bdd (see TESTING.md for rationale)
  - [x] Coverage goal: >80% for Python code
- [x] Reference: "See [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) for complete testing strategy"

### Project Structure Section (Optional)

- [x] Add "## Project Structure" subsection
- [x] Document key directories:
  ```
  gitstory/
  ├── src/gitstory/         # Python package
  │   └── validators/       # Config validators
  ├── tests/                # Unit tests
  ├── docs/                 # Documentation
  │   └── tickets/          # Story hierarchy (INIT→EPIC→STORY→TASK)
  ├── pyproject.toml        # Dependencies and tool configs
  └── TESTING.md            # Testing strategy and philosophy
  ```

### Contributing Section (Optional)

- [x] Add "## Development Workflow" subsection
- [x] Reference story-driven workflow:
  - [x] All work follows ticket hierarchy (see docs/tickets/)
  - [x] See CLAUDE.md for development workflow
  - [x] One commit per task, one PR per story

### License Section (Optional)

- [x] License section already exists in README.md

### Verification

- [x] Read README.md to ensure clarity
- [x] Verify markdown renders correctly
- [x] Test all commands (quality gates passed)
- [x] Check all links work (TESTING.md, CLAUDE.md exist)
- [x] Ensure instructions are accurate and complete

## Files to Create/Modify

- CREATE: `README.md` (~100-150 lines, development setup and workflow documentation)

## Testing Approach

**Manual validation** - verify README renders correctly and instructions work on clean environment.

## Notes

- Keep README concise - focus on getting started quickly
- Reference TESTING.md for detailed testing strategy
- Include the combined quality gates command for convenience
- Emphasize the pragmatic testing approach (unit tests only, no BDD)
- Optional sections (project structure, contributing, license) can be added if helpful

## Success Criteria

- [x] README.md updated with Development section
- [x] Installation instructions clear and complete
- [x] All commands tested and accurate (quality gates passed)
- [x] Testing strategy summarized with reference to TESTING.md
- [x] Development workflow documented
- [x] Markdown renders correctly
- [x] Links to TESTING.md and CLAUDE.md work (files verified)
- [x] Ready for story completion and PR creation
