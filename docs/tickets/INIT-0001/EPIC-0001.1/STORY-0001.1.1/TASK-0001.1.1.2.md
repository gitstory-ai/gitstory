# TASK-0001.1.1.2: Research ALL {baseDir} patterns from anthropics/skills

**Parent Story**: [STORY-0001.1.1](README.md)
**Status**: 🔵 Not Started
**Estimated Hours**: 4
**Actual Hours**: -

## Objective

Deep research dive on every skill in anthropics/skills repository to extract {baseDir} usage patterns. Comprehensive coverage - analyze ALL skills, not just a subset.

## BDD Progress

**Before this task**: 0/3 scenarios passing
**After this task**: 0/3 scenarios passing (research phase, no implementation yet)

**Scenarios for this task:** None (research/foundation work)

## Implementation Checklist

### Repository Research

- [ ] Clone or browse https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-quickstarts/tree/main/skills
- [ ] Record commit SHA for reference stability
- [ ] Identify ALL skills in repository
- [ ] For each skill found:
  - [ ] Search for `{baseDir}` usage in skill files
  - [ ] Extract all code examples showing {baseDir} usage
  - [ ] Note file paths where pattern appears
  - [ ] Categorize pattern usage:
    - [ ] Resource reference (e.g., `{baseDir}/templates/foo.md`)
    - [ ] Path resolution (e.g., reading from `{baseDir}/config/`)
    - [ ] Cross-platform handling
    - [ ] Other patterns
  - [ ] Document in research notes

### Pattern Analysis

- [ ] Review all collected examples
- [ ] Identify common {baseDir} usage patterns across skills
- [ ] Note cross-platform considerations (Windows backslash handling, etc.)
- [ ] Select minimum 3+ best code examples for documentation
- [ ] Identify template lookup patterns (if any exist)
- [ ] Document edge cases (missing files, permission errors, etc.)

### Research Documentation

- [ ] Create `docs/research/baseDir-pattern-analysis.md`
  - [ ] List all skills analyzed with commit SHA
  - [ ] Document findings per skill
  - [ ] Categorize patterns by use case
  - [ ] Include raw code examples (minimum 3+ for README.md)
  - [ ] Note cross-platform compatibility approaches
  - [ ] Identify best practices from anthropic/skills

### Verification

- [ ] Research notes include ALL skills (not just subset)
- [ ] Minimum 3+ code examples extracted for documentation
- [ ] Commit SHA recorded for reference stability
- [ ] Commit: "docs(TASK-0001.1.1.2): Research {baseDir} patterns from ALL anthropic skills"

## Files to Create/Modify

- CREATE: `docs/research/baseDir-pattern-analysis.md` (~500 lines, comprehensive findings from ALL skills)

## Pattern Reuse

None - This is research work with no test patterns to reuse.

## Research Scope

**Comprehensive coverage required:**
- ALL skills in anthropics/skills repository (not limited to 5+)
- Deep analysis of each skill's {baseDir} usage
- Expect 10-20+ skills to analyze depending on repository size
- Research time budgeted at 15-30 min per skill

## Dependencies

- Git access to anthropics/anthropic-quickstarts repository
- Browser or git clone for repository access

## Notes

This is a comprehensive research task. The goal is deep understanding of {baseDir} pattern usage across the entire anthropics/skills ecosystem, not just representative examples. Findings will inform README.md documentation in TASK-0001.1.1.3.
