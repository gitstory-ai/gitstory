# TASK-0001.1.1.4: Verify cross-platform compatibility and complete final BDD

**Parent Story**: [STORY-0001.1.1](README.md)
**Status**: 🔵 Not Started
**Estimated Hours**: 2
**Actual Hours**: -

## Objective

Test directory structure on Linux/macOS, verify git tracking, complete final BDD scenario (placeholder verification), and validate all acceptance criteria met.

## BDD Progress

**Before this task**: 2/3 scenarios passing
**After this task**: 3/3 scenarios passing ✅

**Scenarios for this task:**

- Scenario 3: Directory structure includes placeholders for future epics (FULL implementation)

## Implementation Checklist

### Cross-Platform Testing (Manual)

- [ ] Test on Linux:
  - [ ] Directory creation succeeds
  - [ ] All 4 subdirectories exist
  - [ ] .gitkeep files present
  - [ ] No symlinks required
  - [ ] Permissions correct (0755)

- [ ] Test on macOS (if available):
  - [ ] Directory creation succeeds
  - [ ] All 4 subdirectories exist
  - [ ] .gitkeep files present
  - [ ] No symlinks required
  - [ ] Permissions correct (0755)

- [ ] Document Windows testing deferral:
  - [ ] Note in commit message: "Windows automated testing deferred to EPIC-0001.4 CI"
  - [ ] Pattern expected to work (proven in anthropics/skills)

### Git Tracking Verification

- [ ] Run `git status` - verify .gitkeep files appear
- [ ] Run `git add skills/gitstory/references/.gitkeep`
- [ ] Run `git add skills/gitstory/scripts/.gitkeep`
- [ ] Verify git tracks empty directories via .gitkeep files
- [ ] Confirm no untracked placeholder files

### {baseDir} Pattern Validation

- [ ] Create test SKILL.md with {baseDir} references
  - [ ] Example reference: `{baseDir}/references/workflow-schema.md`
  - [ ] Example reference: `{baseDir}/templates/story.md`
- [ ] Verify {baseDir} resolves correctly in test file
- [ ] Confirm pattern works without symlinks

### Final BDD Implementation (Scenario 3)

- [ ] Implement step: "Given the skills/gitstory/ directory structure"
- [ ] Implement step: "When I check for placeholder files"
- [ ] Implement step: "Then references/.gitkeep exists for EPIC-0001.4 documentation"
- [ ] Implement step: "And scripts/.gitkeep exists for EPIC-0001.2 plugin infrastructure"
- [ ] Implement step: "And git tracks these empty directories"

### Final Validation (All Acceptance Criteria)

- [ ] ✓ Directory structure created: skills/gitstory/ with 4 subdirectories
  - [ ] Edge cases handled (existing dirs, permissions per AC)
- [ ] ✓ All anthropics/skills examples reviewed (TASK-0001.1.1.2)
- [ ] ✓ {baseDir} pattern documented in README.md
- [ ] ✓ Template lookup priority documented
- [ ] ✓ Placeholder files created (.gitkeep in references/ and scripts/)
- [ ] ✓ Cross-platform compatibility verified on Linux/macOS per AC:
  - [ ] Directory creation succeeds
  - [ ] .gitkeep files tracked by git
  - [ ] No symlinks required
  - [ ] {baseDir} pattern resolves correctly in test SKILL.md
- [ ] ✓ Structure matches EPIC-0001.1 spec (verified with `ls -la` comparison per AC)

### Verification

- [ ] Run ALL BDD scenarios - 3/3 pass ✅
- [ ] All acceptance criteria checked
- [ ] Cross-platform verification complete (Linux/macOS)
- [ ] Git tracking confirmed
- [ ] Update story progress to 100%
- [ ] Commit: "feat(TASK-0001.1.1.4): Verify cross-platform compatibility (3/3 BDD passing ✅)"

## Files to Create/Modify

- MODIFY: `tests/e2e/steps/test_skills_directory.py` (implement scenario 3 steps)
- CREATE: `test-SKILL.md` (temporary file for {baseDir} validation, delete after testing)

## Pattern Reuse

None - Final validation and integration work.

## Dependencies

- TASK-0001.1.1.3 complete (directory structure and README.md exist)
- Linux and/or macOS system for manual testing
- Git configured

## Notes

This is the integration task that validates everything works cross-platform and all acceptance criteria are met. Windows testing is deferred to EPIC-0001.4 CI setup, but pattern is proven to work in anthropics/skills (cross-platform tested by Anthropic).

After this task, story is 100% complete and ready for PR.
