# TASK-0001.1.1.3: Write TESTING.md strategy documentation

**Parent Story**: [STORY-0001.1.1](README.md)
**Status**: ✅ Complete
**Estimated Hours**: 2
**Actual Hours**: 0.5

## Objective

Create TESTING.md documentation that explains GitStory's testing philosophy: unit tests for Python code only, NO BDD/pytest-bdd (markdown prompts not suitable), pragmatic approach with >80% coverage goal. Use the content from story Technical Design section as the template.

## Implementation Checklist

### Create TESTING.md File

- [x] Create `TESTING.md` in project root
- [x] Add frontmatter/title: "# GitStory Testing Strategy"

### Philosophy Section

- [x] Copy "Philosophy" section from story Technical Design
- [x] Emphasizes:
  - [x] ✅ Unit test Python code (validators, parsers, workflow plugins)
  - [x] 📝 Document markdown prompts (agents, commands)
  - [x] ❌ No BDD/pytest-bdd (overkill for this use case)

### What We Test Section

- [x] Copy "What We Test" section from story Technical Design
- [x] Documents Python scripts requiring unit tests:
  - [x] Validators (YAML/JSON syntax checking)
  - [x] Workflow Plugins (guards, events, actions - EPIC-0001.2+)
  - [x] Core Scripts (parse_ticket, run_workflow_plugin, validate_workflow)
  - [x] Template Processors (variable substitution, frontmatter parsing)
- [x] Coverage Goal: >80% for all Python code
- [x] Documents markdown prompts (documentation only):
  - [x] Agents (.claude/agents/)
  - [x] Commands (.claude/commands/)
  - [x] Templates (skills/gitstory/templates/)

### Running Tests Section

- [x] Copy "Running Tests" section from story Technical Design
- [x] Include all quality gate commands:
  - [x] `uv run pytest` (all tests)
  - [x] `uv run pytest --cov=src/gitstory --cov-report=html` (coverage)
  - [x] `uv run mypy src` (type checking)
  - [x] `uv run ruff check src tests` (linting)
  - [x] `uv run ruff format src tests` (formatting)
  - [x] Combined quality gates command

### Writing Tests Section

- [x] Copy "Writing Tests" section from story Technical Design
- [x] Include validator test example showing TDD pattern
- [x] Example demonstrates:
  - [x] Valid input test
  - [x] Invalid input test
  - [x] Edge case test (empty content)

### Why No BDD Section

- [x] Copy "Why No BDD?" section from story Technical Design
- [x] Explains rationale:
  - [x] Prompts are hard to test (LLM interpretation variability)
  - [x] Simple scripts don't need BDD (validators/parsers are straightforward)
  - [x] Maintenance burden (scenarios require upkeep, add little value)
  - [x] Time better spent (focus on prompt engineering, not test infrastructure)

### Future Testing Section

- [x] Copy "Future Testing" section from story Technical Design
- [x] Notes potential additions as Python code grows:
  - [x] Integration tests for workflow state machines
  - [x] End-to-end tests for full ticket workflows
  - [x] Property-based tests for parsers
- [x] Emphasizes: "But we'll always avoid BDD for markdown prompts"

### Verification

- [x] Read TESTING.md to ensure clarity and completeness
- [x] Verify markdown renders correctly (headings, code blocks, lists)
- [x] Check all commands are accurate and runnable
- [x] Confirm philosophy section is clear about NO BDD

## Files to Create/Modify

- CREATE: `TESTING.md` (~200 lines, comprehensive testing strategy documentation)

## Content Reference

Use the complete TESTING.md content from story README Technical Design section (lines 106-203). Copy it exactly as specified.

## Testing Approach

**Manual review** - verify documentation is clear, accurate, and renders correctly.

## Notes

- This is a documentation-only task (no code)
- Content template provided in story Technical Design section
- Key message: Unit tests for Python, documentation for markdown prompts, NO BDD
- This testing strategy is intentionally pragmatic for GitStory's use case

## Success Criteria

- [x] TESTING.md created in project root
- [x] All sections present and complete
- [x] Philosophy clearly explains NO BDD approach
- [x] Examples demonstrate TDD pattern
- [x] Commands are accurate and runnable
- [x] Markdown renders correctly
- [x] Ready for TASK-0001.1.1.4 (implement example validator)
