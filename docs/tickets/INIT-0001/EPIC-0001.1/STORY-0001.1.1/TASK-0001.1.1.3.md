# TASK-0001.1.1.3: Write TESTING.md strategy documentation

**Parent Story**: [STORY-0001.1.1](README.md)
**Status**: 🔵 Not Started
**Estimated Hours**: 2
**Actual Hours**: -

## Objective

Create TESTING.md documentation that explains GitStory's testing philosophy: unit tests for Python code only, NO BDD/pytest-bdd (markdown prompts not suitable), pragmatic approach with >80% coverage goal. Use the content from story Technical Design section as the template.

## Implementation Checklist

### Create TESTING.md File

- [ ] Create `TESTING.md` in project root
- [ ] Add frontmatter/title: "# GitStory Testing Strategy"

### Philosophy Section

- [ ] Copy "Philosophy" section from story Technical Design
- [ ] Emphasizes:
  - [ ] ✅ Unit test Python code (validators, parsers, workflow plugins)
  - [ ] 📝 Document markdown prompts (agents, commands)
  - [ ] ❌ No BDD/pytest-bdd (overkill for this use case)

### What We Test Section

- [ ] Copy "What We Test" section from story Technical Design
- [ ] Documents Python scripts requiring unit tests:
  - [ ] Validators (YAML/JSON syntax checking)
  - [ ] Workflow Plugins (guards, events, actions - EPIC-0001.2+)
  - [ ] Core Scripts (parse_ticket, run_workflow_plugin, validate_workflow)
  - [ ] Template Processors (variable substitution, frontmatter parsing)
- [ ] Coverage Goal: >80% for all Python code
- [ ] Documents markdown prompts (documentation only):
  - [ ] Agents (.claude/agents/)
  - [ ] Commands (.claude/commands/)
  - [ ] Templates (skills/gitstory/templates/)

### Running Tests Section

- [ ] Copy "Running Tests" section from story Technical Design
- [ ] Include all quality gate commands:
  - [ ] `uv run pytest` (all tests)
  - [ ] `uv run pytest --cov=src/gitstory --cov-report=html` (coverage)
  - [ ] `uv run mypy src` (type checking)
  - [ ] `uv run ruff check src tests` (linting)
  - [ ] `uv run ruff format src tests` (formatting)
  - [ ] Combined quality gates command

### Writing Tests Section

- [ ] Copy "Writing Tests" section from story Technical Design
- [ ] Include validator test example showing TDD pattern
- [ ] Example demonstrates:
  - [ ] Valid input test
  - [ ] Invalid input test
  - [ ] Edge case test (empty content)

### Why No BDD Section

- [ ] Copy "Why No BDD?" section from story Technical Design
- [ ] Explains rationale:
  - [ ] Prompts are hard to test (LLM interpretation variability)
  - [ ] Simple scripts don't need BDD (validators/parsers are straightforward)
  - [ ] Maintenance burden (scenarios require upkeep, add little value)
  - [ ] Time better spent (focus on prompt engineering, not test infrastructure)

### Future Testing Section

- [ ] Copy "Future Testing" section from story Technical Design
- [ ] Notes potential additions as Python code grows:
  - [ ] Integration tests for workflow state machines
  - [ ] End-to-end tests for full ticket workflows
  - [ ] Property-based tests for parsers
- [ ] Emphasizes: "But we'll always avoid BDD for markdown prompts"

### Verification

- [ ] Read TESTING.md to ensure clarity and completeness
- [ ] Verify markdown renders correctly (headings, code blocks, lists)
- [ ] Check all commands are accurate and runnable
- [ ] Confirm philosophy section is clear about NO BDD

## Files to Create/Modify

- CREATE: `TESTING.md` (~200 lines, comprehensive testing strategy documentation)

## Content Reference

Use the complete TESTING.md content from story README Technical Design section (lines 106-203). Copy it exactly as specified.

## Testing Approach

**Manual review** - verify documentation is clear, accurate, and renders correctly.

## Notes

- This is a documentation-only task (no code)
- Content template provided in story Technical Design section
- Key message: Unit tests for Python, documentation for markdown prompts, NO BDD
- This testing strategy is intentionally pragmatic for GitStory's use case

## Success Criteria

- [ ] TESTING.md created in project root
- [ ] All sections present and complete
- [ ] Philosophy clearly explains NO BDD approach
- [ ] Examples demonstrate TDD pattern
- [ ] Commands are accurate and runnable
- [ ] Markdown renders correctly
- [ ] Ready for TASK-0001.1.1.4 (implement example validator)
