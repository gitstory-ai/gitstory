# TASK-0001.1.1.1: Write BDD scenarios for directory structure

**Parent Story**: [STORY-0001.1.1](README.md)
**Status**: 🔵 Not Started
**Estimated Hours**: 3
**Actual Hours**: -

## Objective

Define WHAT the directory structure should do before implementing HOW. Create all BDD scenarios from story README with stubbed step definitions (all failing).

## BDD Progress

**Before this task**: No BDD tests exist
**After this task**: 0/3 scenarios passing (all stubbed, all failing as expected)

**Scenarios for this task:**

- Scenario 1: Skill directory structure uses {baseDir} pattern
- Scenario 2: {baseDir} pattern resolves correctly in different contexts
- Scenario 3: Directory structure includes placeholders for future epics

## Implementation Checklist

### BDD Scenario Writing

- [ ] Create `tests/e2e/features/skills_directory.feature`
  - [ ] Copy Scenario 1 from story README (directory structure with {baseDir} pattern)
  - [ ] Copy Scenario 2 from story README ({baseDir} resolution in different contexts)
  - [ ] Copy Scenario 3 from story README (placeholder files)
  - [ ] Ensure concrete Given/When/Then steps

### Step Definition Stubs

- [ ] Create `tests/e2e/steps/test_skills_directory.py`
  - [ ] Stub: "Given the GitStory repository"
  - [ ] Stub: "When I create the skills/gitstory/ directory structure"
  - [ ] Stub: "Then it includes skills/gitstory/templates/"
  - [ ] Stub: "And it includes skills/gitstory/commands/"
  - [ ] Stub: "And it includes skills/gitstory/references/"
  - [ ] Stub: "And SKILL.md can reference resources using {baseDir}/..."
  - [ ] Stub: "And pattern works across Linux/macOS/Windows without symlinks"
  - [ ] Stub: "Given skills/gitstory/ installed at ~/.claude/skills/gitstory/"
  - [ ] Stub: "When SKILL.md references {baseDir}/templates/story.md"
  - [ ] Stub: "Then {baseDir} resolves to ~/.claude/skills/gitstory/"
  - [ ] Stub: "And the full path becomes ~/.claude/skills/gitstory/templates/story.md"
  - [ ] Stub: "And the file is accessible to Claude"
  - [ ] Stub: "Given the skills/gitstory/ directory structure"
  - [ ] Stub: "When I check for placeholder files"
  - [ ] Stub: "Then references/.gitkeep exists for EPIC-0001.4 documentation"
  - [ ] Stub: "And scripts/.gitkeep exists for EPIC-0001.2 plugin infrastructure"
  - [ ] Stub: "And git tracks these empty directories"
  - [ ] All step definitions raise NotImplementedError

### Verification

- [ ] Run pytest-bdd tests - all 3 scenarios fail with NotImplementedError ✓
- [ ] Verify feature file parses correctly (no Gherkin syntax errors)
- [ ] Commit: "test(TASK-0001.1.1.1): Write BDD scenarios (0/3 stubbed)"

## Files to Create/Modify

- CREATE: `tests/e2e/features/skills_directory.feature` (~60 lines, 3 Gherkin scenarios)
- CREATE: `tests/e2e/steps/test_skills_directory.py` (~80 lines, stubbed step definitions)

## Pattern Reuse

None - This is foundational BDD work with no existing patterns to reuse.

## Dependencies

- pytest-bdd installed and configured
- tests/e2e/ directory exists

## Notes

This task defines the behavior specification. All scenarios will fail (expected) - implementation happens in subsequent tasks.
