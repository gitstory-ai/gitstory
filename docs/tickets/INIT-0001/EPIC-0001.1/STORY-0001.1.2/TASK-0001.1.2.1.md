# TASK-0001.1.2.1: Research {baseDir} patterns from anthropics/skills

**Parent Story**: [STORY-0001.1.2](README.md)
**Status**: 🔵 Not Started
**Estimated Hours**: 4
**Actual Hours**: -

## Objective

Comprehensive research of {baseDir} pattern usage across ALL skills in anthropics/skills repository. Extract concrete code examples, document path resolution patterns, and understand cross-platform handling. This research informs the README.md documentation in TASK-0001.1.2.2.

## Implementation Checklist

### Repository Access & Setup

- [ ] Browse https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-quickstarts/tree/main/skills
- [ ] Record commit SHA for reference stability
- [ ] Identify all skills in repository (list names)

### Pattern Research (ALL Skills)

- [ ] For each skill found:
  - [ ] Search for `{baseDir}` usage in SKILL.md and other files
  - [ ] Extract code examples showing {baseDir} references
  - [ ] Note file paths where pattern appears
  - [ ] Document pattern categories:
    - Resource references (e.g., `{baseDir}/references/guide.md`)
    - Configuration loading (e.g., `{baseDir}/config/settings.yaml`)
    - Script execution (e.g., `{baseDir}/scripts/helper.sh`)
    - Template references
- [ ] Document findings per skill in research notes

### Pattern Analysis

- [ ] Review all collected examples
- [ ] Identify common {baseDir} usage patterns across skills
- [ ] Note cross-platform considerations (path separators, Windows compatibility)
- [ ] Select minimum 3 best code examples for README.md documentation
- [ ] Document template lookup patterns (if any exist)
- [ ] Note edge cases and best practices

### Documentation

- [ ] Create `docs/research/baseDir-pattern-analysis.md`
  - [ ] List all skills analyzed with commit SHA
  - [ ] Document findings per skill (skill name, {baseDir} usage, file locations)
  - [ ] Categorize patterns by use case
  - [ ] Include 3+ raw code examples for README.md
  - [ ] Note cross-platform compatibility approaches
  - [ ] Identify best practices from anthropics/skills

### Verification

- [ ] Research notes include ALL skills (comprehensive coverage)
- [ ] Minimum 3 code examples extracted and documented
- [ ] Commit SHA recorded for future reference
- [ ] Examples demonstrate different use cases (resource ref, config, scripts)

## Files to Create/Modify

- **CREATE**: `docs/research/baseDir-pattern-analysis.md` (~500 lines, comprehensive research findings)
  - Sections: Skills Analyzed, Commit SHA, Pattern Categories, Code Examples, Best Practices

## Pattern Reuse

None - This is foundational research work with no existing patterns to reuse.

## Dependencies

- Git/browser access to https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-quickstarts
- Ability to browse anthropics/skills repository

## Notes

**Scope**: ALL skills in repository, not just a subset. Goal is deep understanding of {baseDir} pattern across entire anthropics/skills ecosystem.

**Time allocation**: 15-30 minutes per skill for thorough analysis, depending on complexity.

**Deliverable quality**: Research must be comprehensive enough to inform TASK-0001.1.2.2 README.md documentation with concrete, proven examples.
