# TASK-0001.1.2.1: Research {baseDir} patterns from anthropics/skills

**Parent Story**: [STORY-0001.1.2](README.md)
**Status**: ✅ Complete
**Estimated Hours**: 4
**Actual Hours**: 4

## Objective

Comprehensive research of {baseDir} pattern usage across ALL skills in https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-quickstarts/tree/main/skills repository. Extract concrete code examples, document path resolution patterns, and understand cross-platform handling. This research informs the README.md documentation in TASK-0001.1.2.2.

## Implementation Checklist

### Repository Access & Setup

- [x] Browse https://github.com/anthropics/skills (found correct repository)
- [x] Record commit SHA for reference stability (c74d647e56e6daa12029b6acb11a821348ad044b)
- [x] Identify all skills in repository (list names)
- [x] Record total skill count: 'Repository contains 13 skills as of c74d647e56e6daa12029b6acb11a821348ad044b'

### Pattern Research (ALL Skills)

- [x] For each skill found:
  - [x] Search for `{baseDir}` usage in SKILL.md and other files (NOT FOUND)
  - [x] Extract code examples showing actual patterns (${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT})
  - [x] Note file paths where pattern appears (plugins-reference.md)
  - [x] Document pattern categories:
    - MCP Server Configuration
    - Hook Script Execution
    - Environment Variables
    - Relative paths (personal/project skills)
- [x] Document findings per skill in research notes

### Pattern Analysis

- [x] Review all collected examples
- [x] Identify common patterns across skills ({baseDir} absent, ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT} present)
- [x] Note cross-platform considerations (forward slashes, tilde expansion, variable substitution)
- [x] Select minimum 4 code examples for README.md documentation
- [x] Document template lookup patterns (not found in anthropics/skills)
- [x] Note edge cases and best practices

### Documentation

- [x] Create `docs/research/claude-skills-path-pattern-research.md`
  - [x] List all skills analyzed with commit SHA (13 skills documented)
  - [x] Document critical finding: {baseDir} does NOT exist, ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT} is correct pattern
  - [x] Categorize patterns by use case (5 categories)
  - [x] Include 4 raw code examples for README.md
  - [x] Note cross-platform compatibility approaches (forward slashes, variable substitution)
  - [x] Identify best practices from anthropics/skills (progressive disclosure, script organization)

### Verification

- [x] Research notes include ALL skills (13/13 comprehensive coverage)
- [x] Minimum 4 code examples extracted and documented
- [x] Commit SHA recorded for future reference (c74d647e56e6daa12029b6acb11a821348ad044b)
- [x] Examples demonstrate different use cases (MCP, hooks, env vars, relative paths)
- [x] Cross-platform approaches documented (forward slashes mandatory, tilde expansion, ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT} resolution)

## Files to Create/Modify

- **CREATE**: `docs/research/` directory (if not exists) and `docs/research/claude-skills-path-pattern-research.md` (~500 lines, comprehensive research findings)
  - Sections: Skills Analyzed, Commit SHA, Pattern Categories, Code Examples, Best Practices

## Pattern Reuse

None - This is foundational research work with no existing patterns to reuse.

## Dependencies

- Git/browser access to https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-quickstarts/tree/main/skills
- Ability to browse repository

## Notes

**Scope**: ALL skills in repository, not just a subset. Goal is deep understanding of {baseDir} pattern across entire anthropics/skills ecosystem.

**Time allocation**: 15-30 minutes per skill for thorough analysis, depending on complexity.

**Deliverable quality**: Research must be comprehensive enough to inform TASK-0001.1.2.2 README.md documentation with concrete, proven examples.
