# TASK-0001.1.2.3: Research anthropics/skills conventions and create SKILL.md scaffold

**Parent Story**: [STORY-0001.1.2](README.md)
**Status**: 🔵 Not Started
**Estimated Hours**: 4
**Actual Hours**: -

## Objective

Research ALL anthropics/skills repository examples to document conventions, then create skills/gitstory/SKILL.md following those patterns. Completes all remaining BDD scenarios.

## BDD Progress

**Before this task**: 1/3 scenarios passing
**After this task**: 3/3 scenarios passing ✅

**Scenarios for this task:**

- Scenario 2: SKILL.md scaffold provides activation guidance (FULL - implement all steps)
- Scenario 3: SKILL.md follows anthropics/skills conventions (FULL - implement all steps)

## Implementation Checklist

### Research Phase

- [ ] Clone anthropics/skills repository:
  ```bash
  test -d /tmp/anthropics-skills || git clone https://github.com/anthropics/skills /tmp/anthropics-skills
  ```
- [ ] Review ALL skills in repository
- [ ] For each skill, document:
  - [ ] Skill name and repository URL
  - [ ] Heading structure (H1, H2, H3 hierarchy)
  - [ ] Word count (excluding code blocks)
  - [ ] Activation patterns (commands, natural language, patterns)
  - [ ] YAML frontmatter presence/absence
  - [ ] Code example styles
- [ ] Create `docs/tickets/INIT-0001/EPIC-0001.1/STORY-0001.1.2/validation-notes.md` with findings
- [ ] Identify common patterns across ALL skills

### Unit Tests First (TDD - RED)

- [ ] Create `tests/unit/test_skill_md.py`
- [ ] Write test for SKILL.md structure (heading hierarchy)
- [ ] Write test for no YAML frontmatter (first line must be markdown heading)
- [ ] Write test for word count range (200-500 words)
- [ ] Write test for required sections (Activation, Features, Quick Start)
- [ ] Run tests - all fail ✓

### Implementation (GREEN)

- [ ] Create `skills/gitstory/` directory (if not exists with `mkdir -p`)
- [ ] Create `skills/gitstory/SKILL.md` following this structure:

```markdown
# GitStory

## Overview
GitStory provides workflow-agnostic ticket management through Claude Skills, allowing teams to use Scrum, Kanban, or custom workflows without changing tools. Commands adapt to your project's configuration while maintaining consistent ticket hierarchy (INIT→EPIC→STORY→TASK).

## Activation

This skill activates when you:

1. **Commands:** `/gitstory:plan`, `/gitstory:review`, `/gitstory:install`
2. **Natural Language:** "create ticket", "plan epic", "review story quality"
3. **Ticket IDs:** `INIT-*`, `EPIC-*`, `STORY-*`, `TASK-*`, `BUG-*`

## Features

- Template-driven ticket types with YAML frontmatter field schemas
- Configurable commands via YAML (plan.yaml, review.yaml)
- Priority lookup: project → user → skill defaults

## Quick Start

**Example 1: Plan an epic**
```bash
/gitstory:plan EPIC-0001.2
# Creates story breakdown with acceptance criteria
```

**Example 2: Review story quality**
```bash
/gitstory:review STORY-0001.1.3
# Returns quality score and improvement suggestions
```

**Example 3: Install workflow template**
```bash
/gitstory:install scrum
# Configures Scrum-specific ticket templates
```

## Customization

See `{baseDir}/references/` for detailed configuration options.
```

- [ ] Verify word count:
  ```bash
  grep -v '^```' skills/gitstory/SKILL.md | wc -w  # Result: 200-500
  ```
- [ ] Verify heading structure:
  ```bash
  grep '^#' skills/gitstory/SKILL.md | head -5
  # Expected: # GitStory, ## Overview, ## Activation, ## Features, ## Quick Start
  ```
- [ ] Run tests - all pass ✓

### BDD Implementation (Scenarios 2-3)

- [ ] Implement step: "Given skills/gitstory/SKILL.md with activation section"
- [ ] Implement step: "When Claude loads the skill"
- [ ] Implement step: "Then it recognizes command triggers: /gitstory:plan, /gitstory:review, /gitstory:install"
- [ ] Implement step: "And it recognizes natural language triggers"
- [ ] Implement step: "And it recognizes ticket ID patterns"
- [ ] Implement step: "And activation description includes: (1) at least 2 specific example commands..."
- [ ] Implement step: "Given ALL anthropics/skills examples reviewed"
- [ ] Implement step: "When comparing SKILL.md structure"
- [ ] Implement step: "Then it has no YAML frontmatter (first line must be markdown heading)"
- [ ] Implement step: "And it has consistent heading structure matching examples"
- [ ] Implement step: "And word count is appropriate for scope (200-500 words)"
- [ ] Run BDD tests - All 3 scenarios pass ✅

### Verification

- [ ] All unit tests pass (>90% coverage)
- [ ] All BDD scenarios pass (3/3 passing ✅)
- [ ] SKILL.md renders correctly in markdown preview:
  - [ ] All headings render with proper hierarchy (H1, H2, H3)
  - [ ] Bulleted lists display with proper indentation
  - [ ] Code blocks display with syntax highlighting
  - [ ] Links are clickable and properly formatted
  - [ ] No raw markdown syntax visible
- [ ] Word count: 250-350 words (target range within 200-500)
- [ ] Validation notes document ALL skills reviewed

## Files to Create/Modify

- CREATE: `skills/gitstory/SKILL.md` (~350 words, ~60 lines)
- CREATE: `docs/tickets/INIT-0001/EPIC-0001.1/STORY-0001.1.2/validation-notes.md` (~200 lines, research documentation)
- CREATE: `tests/unit/test_skill_md.py` (~80 lines, structure tests)
- MODIFY: `tests/e2e/steps/test_skill_scaffold.py` (implement steps for Scenarios 2-3)

## Pattern Reuse

- `markdown_word_count` (wc -w with code block exclusion) - Count words in markdown excluding code blocks using `grep -v '^```' SKILL.md | wc -w`

## Edge Cases Handled

- If skills/gitstory/ directory missing → Create parent directories with `mkdir -p skills/gitstory` before writing SKILL.md
- If SKILL.md exists → Fail with error message: 'SKILL.md already exists at skills/gitstory/SKILL.md. Delete or rename before regenerating.'

## Performance Targets

- Word count: 250-350 words (excluding code blocks)
- Heading depth: Maximum H3 (no H4 or deeper)
- Research documentation: List ALL skills reviewed with specific details
