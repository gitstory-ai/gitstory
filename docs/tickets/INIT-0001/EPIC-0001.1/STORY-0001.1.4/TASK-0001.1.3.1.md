# TASK-0001.1.3.1: Research anthropics/skills and create config.json

**Parent Story**: [STORY-0001.1.3](README.md)
**Status**: 🔵 Not Started
**Estimated Hours**: 5
**Actual Hours**: -

## Objective

Research SKILL.md structure patterns from anthropics/skills repository and create valid .claude-plugin/config.json for marketplace registration. This establishes the foundation for SKILL.md creation in TASK-0001.1.3.2.

## Implementation Checklist

### Skills Repository Research

- [ ] Browse https://github.com/anthropics/skills (anthropic-quickstarts repo)
- [ ] Identify and review 3+ published skills
- [ ] For each skill reviewed, document:
  - [ ] Skill name
  - [ ] Heading structure (h1, h2 sections)
  - [ ] Activation section format and placement
  - [ ] Word count range (approximate)
  - [ ] Code block usage patterns
  - [ ] Whether YAML frontmatter exists (should be NO)
- [ ] Create research notes: `docs/research/skill-structure-analysis.md`
  - [ ] List all 3+ skills reviewed
  - [ ] Common patterns identified
  - [ ] Heading hierarchy standards
  - [ ] Activation trigger examples
  - [ ] Best practices observed

### Create .claude-plugin/config.json

- [ ] Create `.claude-plugin/` directory if needed: `mkdir -p .claude-plugin`
- [ ] Create `.claude-plugin/config.json` with 9 required fields:
  - [ ] `name`: "gitstory"
  - [ ] `id`: "gitstory-ai/gitstory"
  - [ ] `version`: "0.1.0"
  - [ ] `entry_point`: "skills/gitstory/SKILL.md"
  - [ ] `author`: "Bram Swenson"
  - [ ] `description`: "Workflow-agnostic ticket management via plugin-based state machines"
  - [ ] `keywords`: Array with 8 items (workflow, tickets, state-machine, planning, BDD, kanban, scrum, agile)
  - [ ] `license`: "MIT"
  - [ ] `repository`: "https://github.com/gitstory-ai/gitstory"

### Validation

- [ ] Validate JSON syntax:
  ```bash
  python -m json.tool .claude-plugin/config.json
  ```
- [ ] Verify all 9 required fields present
- [ ] Verify keywords array has 8 items
- [ ] Verify entry_point path is correct (relative from repo root)
- [ ] Note: Entry point file doesn't exist yet (created in TASK-0001.1.3.2)

### Optional: Python Unit Test

Per TESTING.md, Python unit tests can be written for config validation:

- [ ] Create `tests/test_skill_config.py` (optional, recommended for EPIC-0001.2)
- [ ] Test: JSON file exists and is valid
- [ ] Test: All 9 required fields present
- [ ] Test: Entry point path format correct (will verify file exists in TASK-0001.1.3.2)

Note: Python tests are optional for this task - can defer to EPIC-0001.2 (Core Scripts & Infrastructure).

## Files to Create/Modify

- **CREATE**: `docs/research/skill-structure-analysis.md` (~300 lines, research findings from 3+ skills)
  - Sections: Skills Reviewed, Common Patterns, Heading Structure, Activation Formats, Best Practices
- **CREATE**: `.claude-plugin/` (directory)
- **CREATE**: `.claude-plugin/config.json` (~15 lines, JSON with 9 required fields)
- **CREATE** (optional): `tests/test_skill_config.py` (~50 lines, Python unit tests)

## Pattern Reuse

None - This is research and configuration work with no existing patterns to reuse.

## Dependencies

- STORY-0001.1.2 complete: Verify with `test -d skills/gitstory && test -f skills/gitstory/README.md && grep -q '{baseDir}' skills/gitstory/README.md`
- Browser/git access to https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-quickstarts
- Python 3.12+ for validation

## Notes

**Testing strategy**: Per TESTING.md, this is configuration work. Manual validation using bash commands is primary approach. Python unit tests are optional and can be deferred to EPIC-0001.2.

**Research scope**: Review at least 3 skills, document common patterns thoroughly to inform SKILL.md creation in next task.

**Entry point path**: Use `skills/gitstory/SKILL.md` (relative from repo root). File will be created in TASK-0001.1.3.2.
